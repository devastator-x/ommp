## Before You Start

### Nerd Font (required)

OMMP uses [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) icons throughout the interface. Without one installed, icons will appear as broken squares.

Recommended fonts: **JetBrainsMono Nerd Font**, **MesloLGS NF**, **FiraCode Nerd Font**

After installing, set it as your terminal's font.

### Terminal (recommended: Kitty)

OMMP works in any terminal with true color (24-bit) support, but **[Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)** is recommended for the best experience — album art is displayed at full quality using Kitty's native image protocol.

Other terminals with Sixel support (foot, WezTerm) also display album art well. Standard terminals fall back to block-character rendering.

### Audio

PulseAudio or ALSA is required for audio output on Linux.

## Install

Make sure you have [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) installed, then run:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/devastator-x/ommp
```

That's it. Now you can run `ommp` from anywhere:

```bash
ommp
```

<details>
<summary><code>ommp: command not found</code>?</summary>

`~/.cargo/bin` may not be in your PATH. Add this line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
```

Restart your terminal to apply.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Build from source</summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/devastator-x/ommp.git
cd ommp
cargo build --release
./target/release/ommp
```

</details>

## Usage

Place your music files in `~/Music` and run `ommp`. It will automatically scan all files and subdirectories.

Album art is detected automatically — just place `cover.jpg`, `folder.jpg`, `front.jpg`, or any image file in the same directory as your tracks.

### Browsing

The screen is split into three panels:

- **Left** — Library browser (artists, albums, genres, etc. depending on the active tab)
- **Center** — Play queue
- **Right** — Album art / Clock (top) + Lyrics (bottom)

Switch browsing modes using the tabs at the top: Queue, Directories, Artists, Albums, Genre, Format, Playlists

### Search

Press `Ctrl+E, s` to open the search modal. Results filter as you type.

You can also search by specific fields:

- `artist:radiohead` — search by artist
- `album:ok computer` — search by album
- `genre:rock` — search by genre
- `*.flac` — filter by format
